scientific-computing-python-projects

This repository contains five projects completed as part of the Scientific Computing with Python certification from FreeCodeCamp. Each project demonstrates problem-solving skills and the ability to apply Python concepts such as data structures, string manipulation, and algorithms.

Projects Included:
	1.	Project 1 - Arithmetic Formatter 
 
  a Python program that takes a list of simple arithmetic problems (addition and subtraction) and arranges them in a properly formatted vertical layout. It ensures correct spacing, alignment, and formatting, with an optional feature to display the answers. The program also validates input, enforcing rules like limiting the number of problems, allowing only digits, and restricting operand length to four digits.
